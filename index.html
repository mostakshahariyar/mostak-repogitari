			<h3>Singing Song and Dance nice</h3>
			<p>A singer is a person who sings. Anyone who is singing is a singer. Some people do it as a job
				(professional
				singer), others may sing without being paid (amateur singer). Singers may sing anything:
				songs,
				opera
				etc. They may be accompanied by an instrument or an orchestra. Some singers also play a
				musical
				instrument such as piano, guitar or harp while they sing (they accompany themselves).
				Singing is
				important in movies and in the theatre.</p>

			<h3>Become a Movie Hero</h3>
			<p class="dream">A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually
				occur
				involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep.[1] The content and
				function of dreams are not fully understood, although they have been a topic of
				scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history.
				Dream interpretation is the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching
				for an underlying message. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology
