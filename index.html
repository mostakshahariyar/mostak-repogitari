			<h3>Singing Song and Dance nice</h3>
			<p>A singer is a person who sings. Anyone who is singing is a singer. Some people do it as a job
				(professional
				singer), others may sing without being paid (amateur singer). Singers may sing anything:
				songs,
				opera
				etc. They may be accompanied by an instrument or an orchestra. Some singers also play a
				musical
				instrument such as piano, guitar or harp while they sing (they accompany themselves).
				Singing is
				important in movies and in the theatre.</p>
